## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project helped me to deepen my understanding about CSS style, mainly in element positioning.

I learned about the Pseudoselectors and the syntasis tu use them to define more specific and efficient selectors:
```css
.card-designer-text a:is(:link, :visited){
    color: var(--white);
}
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about responsive design and techniques to make more professional webs (like Mobile First)

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks PseudoSelector](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/i/is/) - This helped me to understand more about the pseudoselector :is and its syntaxis

I want to thank to [Bit Crew](https://github.com/Bit-crew). His solution for this challenge was clear and helped me to realize the last details to improve the design (for example, the transition in elements that change with :hover state).
